# Online Learning Platform

Welcome to our Online Learning Platform, where learners can access a variety of courses, track their progress, and enhance their knowledge. This simple JavaScript-based application provides a foundation for building a comprehensive online learning platform.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and track their enrolled courses and progress.
- **Course Management**: Administrators can add, manage, and organize courses, complete with titles and descriptions.
- **Enrollment**: Users can enroll in courses to access educational content.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their course progress, ensuring they stay on the path to learning success.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the JavaScript script to start the learning platform.
3. Create an account, enroll in courses, and explore the world of knowledge.

## Code Structure

The code structure of this application includes:

- `User` and `Course` classes: Define user and course attributes.
- `LearningPlatform` class: Manages user accounts, courses, and enrollment.
- Main Application: The main script that handles user interactions and program flow.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and serves as a starting point. For a production-level online learning platform, you would need to incorporate a web framework (e.g., Express.js), a database (e.g., MongoDB), and enhance the user authentication and course management features.
